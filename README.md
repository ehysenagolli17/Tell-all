# Tell-all
Nowdays, with all the technology we have, is important to spread the information and automatization in order to help everyone in daily life. Our country faces many problems in businesses, education system, transportation and employement, but what caught our eye is that public transportation is very informal and people that travel everyday from one city to another find it very stressful.  

So, our idea is to build up a system that helps Municipality of Tirana and other cities, drivers, administrators and most importantly everyone who need transportation. The national transportation with buses in our country is in a bit of a chaos. There is very little automation which creates difficulties in organizing the system. This is the reason we found it logical to create a software that addresses that.

The information people have about buses that travel from city to city is limited and comes from word-of-mouth. That is what our project aims to resolve. We want to create a software where municipality manages employees, drivers and help people to get information about timetables, destinations, buses used, travel agencies and everything else. Besides information, the most important element is ticket reservation. Travelers can enter our software to buy tickets, know their reserved seat and choose their leaving and returning time. Each economic transaction goes directly to the economist account.
